# Data Engineering
This repository contains the code for the data engineering projects that I have worked. 

## Folder structure
+ businessWorkPlan: this contains the work plan for the business problem for a big pharma company related to Chemical fingerprinting.
+ dataEngineeringProject: this project is to create a database and ingest, transfer and load data from a csv file using python. This is reproducable as it uses docker to containerize the application.
